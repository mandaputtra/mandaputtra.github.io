I always wanted to be Open-First Developer. Like [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify), [Sindresohus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) or many of them that contribute a lot on [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_software_organizations).

I had a beileve that [Open Source Software](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+open+source&oq=what+are+open+source&aqs=chrome..69i57.7823j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (OSS) can be powerfull empowering nowadays future. So I want to be part of them by make OSS that can help somebody or at least me ðŸ˜„ because perfect to me is that "I still can help somebody else".
