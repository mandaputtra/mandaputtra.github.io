**Hi** I was born in Kulonprogo Yogyakarta 1997. I love computer since my father bought them in 2002. This is where I know such a nice game like [Harvestmoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)).

My journey on code began since I know how to write C++ and some Bash script at young age. I found it powerfull and painfull, so I decided not to take any Computer Science Degree, But with coincidence I jump into Computer Science class in University.

That wasn't a good smooth way for me to learn programming again, and I've never finish my college degree (not to mention Zuck/Bill) somehow I just decided to quit.

Before quiting college I'm an active person in some community (if I may say). I got chance to became a mentor **GDG Web Study Jam** and give at least 2 talk that year (2018).

After quiting college, I became freelance web developer. I found web are intersting and can be **powerfull!** I began my first journey with [PHP](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/why-use-php/) and somehow now I'm more interested in [Node.js](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5?gi=67c0ae74d38d).

Now I'm working at [Maxsol.id](https://maxsol.id/) in Bali my first company. But I'm still open for ~~freelance~~ hehe. Any intersting project? Contact me lest see what [I can do]().
