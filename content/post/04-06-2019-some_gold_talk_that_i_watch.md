Hi now I would love to share some gold talks around programming that I found over on the Internet, the talk kinda not just cover on Node.js world but also progrramming in general. This talk are mostly opinion so don't take it seriously if you think it isn't right, take that seriously and tweet/email at man/woman who give presentation not me, however if you think I should explain on some topics, I would love to explain if I could do that.

### Brian Will on OOP

First talk are from youtuber named Brian Will, *I think* he hates OOP as main programming pradigm that kinda spread on the market now he talk about that in the following videos he posted on his youtube, his videos :

  - [Object Oriented Programming Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbXsrHGhBAU&t=34s)

I recommend watching that first If you did not know about OOP he explain it well, more well than my lecture. Then if you understand it and have some application written on OOP, like really OOPish like this [app](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) You maybe want to watch this later talk then

  - [Object Oriented Programming is Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&t=449s)
  - [Object Oriented Programming is Embarasing : 4 Short Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRTfhkiAqPw)
  - [Object Oriented Programming is Garbage : 3800 LOC Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6VP-2aIcSc&t=729s)

Then watch this talk from him too after that 3 talk and now you understand why he talk like that.

  - [Object Oriented Programming is Good*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iyB0_qPvWk&t=70s)

My response on Brian W. talk was, this guy is awesome. I written some game back-then with C++ (this had class comparing to C) I dont know github back-then and I forgot what books do I read, however there is some group at facebook named *C/C++/C# Developer Indonesia* I think I got that book from there.

It was game development book and its heavily OOPish (I know OOP because that books said so) writting on OOP are good for sharing data beetween game class, but the code can be decoupled and make things more complicated. I started confuse myself on what is this thing, how it work? If you never developing a game that shared states beetwen class, its kinda hard to know what is this guy talking about.

I agree on Brian Will, OOP are complicated, but in some ways it simplify on making docs, and refactoring on IDE. Some OOP language had this beautiful refactoring tool that soo powerfull like Java. However the decoupled thing on OOP and this should be here this should be here can make you confuse.

I love TS, I love the type cheking but why people keep coined that Strict Type programming language are easy to maintain? It is not, there will be a bug, Interface and Decorators can't save you from bugs. JavaScript nowadays are trying to be "Hey use TS bro, not JS" why?

Procedural, Imperative, [Light Functional](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) Programming are still the best for me. I think we should combine all the good from programming paradigm, and use it as new paradigm.

Go checkout Brian Will he had many videos, that covers most on programming basics, and some programming pragmatic, or just awesome game development.
